# 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend software engineer with **5 years of professional experience in Python**, and a recent **MSc graduate in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence** from **Hong Kong Baptist University**.

I specialize in building **scalable backend systems**, crafting **clean APIs (REST & GraphQL)**, and working with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and other relational databases. I've designed and delivered **production-ready services**—from **permission systems** and **OAuth2 integrations** to internal **SDKs** that streamline team workflows. I value **clean architecture**, **coding standards**, and enjoy **mentoring junior developers**.

## 🧠 Current Focus

I'm actively transitioning into **LLM Application Engineering**, **MLOps**, and **ML Engineering**, where I can combine my backend expertise with applied machine learning and AI deployment. 

As part of my MSc journey, I completed projects on **facial expression recognition**, applying:
- **StyleGAN2-ADA** for synthetic data generation
- **ResNet**, **EfficientNet** for classification
- **UMAP**, **t-SNE** for visualization
- Training pipelines built with **PyTorch Lightning** and tracked using **Weights & Biases (wandb)**

I’m also exploring **LLM-powered systems** with **LangChain**, **Transformers**, and model deployment using **TorchServe**, **FastAPI**, and **Docker**.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **Languages**: Python (Primary), SQL (Working Proficiency)
- **API**: REST, GraphQL, FastAPI
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Flask, Django, PyTorch Lightning, LangChain
- **ML/AI**: Transformers, LoRA, RAG, CNNs, GANs, Diffusion Models
- **MLOps & DevOps**: Docker, TorchServe, Triton, MLflow, CI/CD, wandb, Git
- **Tools**: FAISS, TensorBoard, UMAP, t-SNE, PCA
- **Cloud & Deployment**: Heroku, HuggingFace Hub, Dockerized bots, scalable microservices

## 🌍 Languages & Communication

- Native **Chinese** speaker  
- Fluent in **English**  
- Passionate about **cross-language expression** and grammar insights

## 🏋️ Personal Interests

I’m committed to **fitness and mental clarity**, I believe that physical health sharpens discipline and focus.

I enjoy solving problems through **systems thinking** and thrive on connecting the dots between **engineering**, **data**, and **real-world usability**. Whether it’s **debugging backend bottlenecks** or **optimizing training pipelines**, I aim to build solutions that are both **elegant and practical**.
