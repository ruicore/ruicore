### Hi there 👋 I'm [@Rui HE](https://github.com/ruicore)

I'm a web backend developer, currently working at a small company. I'm also a student of Information Management and Information System at Wuhan University of Technology.

I currently live in HongKong.

I mainly use Python to develop web applications. I also have some experience with TypeScript, and Go.

I created a package called [ExcelAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/ExcelAlchemy/) to help me deal with Excel files. It's a wrapper of [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) and [panadas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/). It's still in development, but it's already usable. It's mainly used to import and export Excel files, load excel data into pydantic models, and export pydantic models to Excel files.

If you find it useful, please give it a star. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue or contact me.

I currently use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to develop web applications. I also use [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to connect to the database. I use [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) to validate data. I use [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) to run the application. I use [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database and [redis](https://redis.io/) as the cache.
