# 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend software engineer with **5 years of professional experience in Python**, currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence** at **Hong Kong Baptist University**.

I specialize in building **scalable backend systems**, crafting **clean APIs (REST & GraphQL)**, and working with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and other relational databases.

Over the years, I’ve designed and delivered **production-ready services**—from **permission systems** and **OAuth2 integrations** to internal **SDKs** that streamline team workflows. I value **clean architecture**, **coding standards**, and enjoy **mentoring junior developers**.


## 🧠 Current Focus

I'm currently exploring the **intersection of software engineering and machine learning**.

My academic research focuses on **facial expression recognition** using CNNs and **GAN-generated synthetic data**, with hands-on experiments involving:
- **StyleGAN2-ADA**
- **ResNet**, **EfficientNet**
- **UMAP**, **t-SNE**
- Tracked using **PyTorch Lightning** and **Weights & Biases (wandb)**

I also build **full-stack projects** such as **Telegram chatbots** deployed using **Docker and Heroku** as part of my learning and teaching journey.


## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Flask, Django, PyTorch Lightning, SQLAlchemy  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Git, Heroku, CI/CD pipelines  
- **ML/AI**: CNNs, GANs, Transformers, Diffusion Models, Performance Optimization  
- **Tools**: wandb, TensorBoard, UMAP, t-SNE, PCA  
- **Deployment**: Webhooks, Heroku, Dockerized bots, RESTful microservices  


## 🌍 Languages & Communication

- Native **Chinese** speaker  
- Proficient in **English**  
- Passionate about **cross-language expression** and grammar insights


## 🏋️ Personal Interests

I’m committed to **fitness and mental clarity**:
- I **exercise daily**, practice **intermittent fasting**
- Currently maintianing body fat around **17%
- Believe that physical health sharpens discipline and focus

I enjoy solving problems through **systems thinking** and thrive on connecting the dots between **engineering**, **data**, and **real-world usability**.  Whether it’s **debugging backend bottlenecks** or **optimizing training pipelines**, I strive to build solutions that are both **elegant and practical**.
